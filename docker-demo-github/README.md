# What is Docker
> Docker is an open platform for Developers and SysOps to build, ship and deploy application fast and stable. Docker Engine can be installed on cross platforms Windows, Linux and macOS. Docker enable the option to share your images fast with your team, and you can easy use CI/CD tools to automatic deploy to Docker Swarm or just a orther Docker system.

# Docker

# Docker Registry
> To storge your docker images when you are build can be done in differend way, a lot of people are using [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) becures its free when you push public images to it, its just require you to create a Docker account. But its can be very useful to know how you can setup and running your own [Docker Registry](https://www.pnk.sh/skills/docker-registry) if you grow and have some orther requirements you need.

**Video Courses**
- [Docker Registry](https://www.pnk.sh/courses/docker-registry) - 7 videos with 44 min playtime.

# Docker Swarm
> Learn how you use [Docker Swarm](https://www.pnk.sh/skills/docker-swarm) and how its working with my tutorials about Docker Swarm. Docker Swarm is the way Docker service allows all your containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons on differend servers.

**Video Courses**
- [Docker Swarm](https://www.pnk.sh/courses/docker-swarm) - 16 videos with 1 hour 58 min playtime.

# Docker Application Blueprints

# Scale Software with Docker
> To run morderen software its very importen its scaling in the right way so you don't need to focus on a single server but focus on the software you are developering as developer. This overview helps you to look witchs software there can be working with Docker and how you can scale it by using Docker Swarm.

## WordPress
> WordPress its not build to scale, but if you are using its currect, you can get the benefits of WordPress core, build your own plugins and then scale up with Docker Swarm and stop maintain single WordPress instans.
